\subsection{Jacobi's method}

\begin{align*}
t &= \tau \pm \sqrt{1+\tau^2}\\ 
c &= \cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\tan^2\theta}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+t^2}}\\
s &= \sin \theta = \tan \theta \cos \theta = t c\\
\end{align*}

\subsection{The algorithm}



	Metode
Algorigmer: Jacobi, rhomax
valg av epsilon ("0")

Forelesning: Konvergens etter mellom 12n3 og 20n3, vi har mye kjappere!!!!!


\subsection{Unit tests}

In this project we used two unit tests to ensure that the program performs as expected and delivers accurate enough results. 

One way to be sure that our algorithm gives correct answers is to task it to find the eigenvalues of a matrix with known eigenvalues. These values had been pre calculated by Matlab. 

The other unit test we utilized was to check that our algorithm to find the largest off-diagonal elements actually found the largest off-diagonal elements. This was done by setting up a known matrix and tasking our algorithm to find the largest off-diagonal element and checking it against the manually found largest element. 




Other tests: Orthogonality, norm(A) = norm(B), symmetric
