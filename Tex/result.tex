The eigenvalues converges towards the excact solutions  $ \lambda_1=3, \lambda_2 =7  $ and $ \lambda_3 =11 $ for each increase in mesh size  ($ N\times N $) in table \ref{tab:eigval}. The lower the  eigenvalue, the quicker it converges. 

The energies corresponding to the dimensionless energies $\lambda_1 = 3 $, $\lambda_2 = 7 $ and $\lambda_3 = 11$ are $ 81.6 $ eV,  $ 190.4 $ eV and $ 299.3 $ eV respectively.

As expected, the brute force method of the Jacobi algorithm is much slower than the algorithm used by armadillo and LAPACK. LAPACK is up to approximately 2 500 times faster. The higher calculation costs of the Jacobi method is also reflected in the amount of similarity transforms required.  In figure \ref{fig:n} the development of the amount of similarity transforms as a function of N was approximated with the function $ y = 1.806*(x-1.039)^2 + b $. This shows that for our tridiagonal matrix and choices of $ \epsilon $, the Jacobi method converges after approximately $1.81n^2 $ similarity transforms.

Table \ref{tab:omega} shows that higher values of $ \omega_r$ yields higher energies, which is as expected from section \ref{jacobi}. The values of $ \omega_r= 0.05   $ and $ \omega_r= 0.25   $  corresponds to exactly double that of what is found in the article by M. Taut, \cite{litterature}.
