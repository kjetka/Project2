Many problems in physics are eigenvalue problems [referanse. er dette sant egentlig? Ifølge wikipedia ja...]. Especially when we are at the quantum level. The Schrödinger equation with different potentials are an important example and that is the eigenvalue problem this report will attend to.

In this report we will use Jacobi's method to solve an eigenvalue problem. The eigenvalue problem is the Schrödinger equation for both a single electron in a harmonic potential and two electrons in a harmonic potential that are interacting by a Coulomb potential.

The report starts with some theory on how the equations are scaled and made dimensionless and how the problem ends up being a eigenvalue problem with a tridiagonal matrix. On this form, the problem can be solved numerically with Jacobi's method. After that, the algorithm with the unit tests are described in the method. Then, the results are presented in different tables. In the end a discussion of the results are made. At last the report is summarized in the conclusion.
